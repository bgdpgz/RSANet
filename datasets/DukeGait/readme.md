# Tutorial for BUAA-Duke-Gait
## Download the BUAA-Duke-Gait dataset
Download the dataset (1x64x64 silhouette shape) from the [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p5b6R_Q3cKqKtgwCv3-i7g?pwd=3yth).
Then you will get BUAA-Duke-Gait formatted as:
```
    DATASET_ROOT/
        0001 (subject)/
            00 (type)/
                cam2_46186_47066 (view)/
                    cam2_46186_47066.pkl (contains all frames)
                ......
            ......
        ......
```
The dataset comes from RealGait, which borrows data from [DukeMTMC-VideoReID](https://github.com/Yu-Wu/DukeMTMC-VideoReID?tab=readme-ov-file).
